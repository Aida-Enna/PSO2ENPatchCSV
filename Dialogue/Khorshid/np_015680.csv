11_voice_NPC_5568_202#0,"""Ah, Leader. How are you doing?<br>...What's wrong? You have an odd look on your face. Is there something strange about my appearance?"""
11_voice_NPC_5499_204#0,"""Hehe, it feels weird to have Khorshid here on the ARKS Ship, doesn't it?"""
text01003#0,"""It's just as weird for me. It's not so long ago that I wouldn't have dreamed of spending any time in a place like this..."""
text01004#0,"""If I hadn't met you and Gene, I would never have even heard of ARKS, or known all the things you do."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#0,"""I had something to ask you, but...<br>It can wait. Speak to me whenever you're ready to hear it."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_101#0,"""You ARKS have a lot of customs with no parallels in Erzimarut culture. Very interesting."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_202#1,"""Akhtar came here before? Hmm...<br>I can't see any sign of her anywhere."""
text03001#0,"""You ARKS have all sorts of clothes. Look at that woman there. Her outfit is both fashionable and cute."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_104#0,"""That could look good on Akhtar.<br>She's worn the same clothes ever since she became a Darknix."""
text03003#0,"""I think it would look good on you too, Khorshid. Oh... maybe it would be a little tight around the chest..."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_106#0,"""You're one to talk, Gene. Honestly. Perhaps I'd be able to wear clothes like yours, then."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_104#1,"""I wanted to go on a mission, if possible... But when I transform, I spread Darker Factor around me."""
text04002#0,"""If I transformed, I might be mistaken for a hostile.<br>...I want to avoid looking suspicious."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_204#0,"""...Still, being cooped up and unable to fight is grating. I hate having to ask for your help.."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#1,"""I think there are more ARKS starting conversations with me than there were before."""
text05002#0,"""It used to be that they didn't dare approach me. Perhaps dealing with my stress has made me less tense."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_201#0,"""All thanks to you and Gene. It's important that cultural exchanges like this are fun. Heheh, thank you, Leader."""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#2,"""ひさしぶりだな、リーダー。<br>しばらく顔を合わせる機会がなかったが<br>壮健そうで、なによりだ。"""
text02#0,"""今回のアークスシップへの滞在は<br>妹のアフタルも一緒だ。<br>騒がしくなると思うがよろしく頼む。"""
text03#0,"""貴公と会えない日々が続いて<br>アフタルも寂しがっていたからな。<br>あとで声をかけてやってくれ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_205#3,"""戦闘で使用するダークニクスボディと<br>日常生活を行うための生身の体には<br>外見上ほとんど違いはない。"""
text02#1,"""まあ、エルジマルトの者ならば<br>少しの差ですぐに見分けられるが……<br>アークスはどうだろうな？"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_203#0,"""なあ、リーダー。<br>今の私の体は、どちらだと思う？"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_104#2,"""なあ、リーダー。<br>最近アフタルの顔が少し<br>丸くなっている気がしないか？"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_100#0,"""……やはりそうか。<br>アークスシップに来てから明らかに<br>食べる量が増えているからな。"""
text03#1,"""あとでトレーニングルームに誘って<br>みっちりしごくとしよう。"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_204#1,"""ふぅ、デスクワークが続くと<br>肩がこってたまらんな。"""
text02#2,"""あとでまたアフタルに<br>肩もみを頼むとしよう。<br>……貴公、なんだその手は？"""
text01#0,"""復興作業に協力的なアークスが<br>ずいぶんと増えてきたようだ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_201#1,"""これも貴公やジェネたちが<br>率先して協力してくれたおかげだ。<br>深く感謝している。"""
11_voice_NPC_5568_202#2,"""まだまだ復興作業は続いていくが……<br>貴公が一緒なら何の不安もない。<br>今後も頼りにしているぞ、リーダー。"""

Kuro_01_030#0,"""Hmm, it was asking about a cute girl? So, why are you coming to me?"""
Kuro_01_040#0,"""Wait, a cute girl? What the hell?! I'm a guy!"""
Kuro_01_050#0,"""Damn it! If you see that cat again, let me know! Don't forget it!"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_101#0,"""Oh, nice timing, partner."""
Afin_favs_before_020#0,"""There was something I wanted to give you. Here, take this."""
Afin_favs_before_030#0,"""I won't use it, so it's better off in your hands."""

11_voice_NPC_5003_101#1,"""Wow... This place is huge! It's way different from where I lived before. Well, that place was pretty big too."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#0,"""I can't believe we survived running into Darkers on our very first mission. We must be super lucky! Haha."""
Afin_02_020#0,"""It was pretty scary at the time, but now that I can look back on it, I feel good about how we handled it."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_106#0,"""I was surprised to find out that ARKS basically live normal lives. I was expecting things to be a lot stricter."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_108#0,"""We're still pretty new, so the places and planets we can go to are limited."""
Afin_04_020#0,"""If we want to go to more places, we'll have to prove ourselves first. We've got a long road ahead of us, partner."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#0,"""As ARKS, we command a lot of respect, but that doesn't mean we can just do whatever we want."""
Afin_05_020#0,"""They might let us get away with unbecoming behaviour from time to time, but make no mistake, they're always watching us."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#1,"""It's so nice here. I want to spend all my time relaxing. But as soon as they assign me a mission, I have to leave..."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#2,"""There's a lot of different skills, aren't there? It's kind of hard to remember them all."""
Afin_07_020#0,"""Still, you never know when they could come in handy, so I guess I should just knuckle down and learn them."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#1,"""Hmmm... I don't have any good weapons. I wonder if there are any new ones I could get?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#0,"""I joined ARKS to look for someone, so I prefer to use lighter weapons."""
Afin_09_020#0,"""...But when I tell people that, they get mad at me because they think I don't take fighting seriously. I don't want to come off like I'm not serious."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#1,"""We can switch our class freely, but the older ARKS don't have that option.<br>...I wonder what changed?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#2,"""Not all ARKS are fighters. I've heard a rumor saying that there's a team of ARKS who buy and sell information.<br>...I wonder if I could do that?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#3,"""I knew finding someone out there wouldn't be easy, but this is taking way longer than I thought. I guess I'll just have to be patient."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_109#0,"""Even more Darkers! It feels like we've been running into them all over the place lately. Maybe it's just me."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_101#2,"""Seeing you complete so many Client Orders is making me happy, too. Haha."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_108#1,"""The other day, one of the other ARKS told me \""You don't have any courage, but at least you're aware of that.\"" That's a bit harsh, don't you think?"""
Afin_15_020#0,"""The scary part is that there's people out there who don't have any more courage than I do, but think they do.<br>...I guess they're just reckless."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_105#2,"""I was wondering. How long have the Darkers have been our enemies? History was never my strong point."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#4,"""I've wanted to be an ARKS as long as I can remember...<br>I never realized it would be this tiring, though... Ha..."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_100#3,"""Who are the strongest ARKS? I guess that would be the Council of Six. I wonder what they're like. Do you think they're all super-buff?"""
Afin_18_020#0,"""...Huh? You say they're out in the field right now? Does that mean you've met them already?"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_109#1,"""It's funny how everyone's so calm even though the ARKS ship was just attacked. I guess people around here must be used to that kind of thing."""
Afin_19_020#0,"""...I feel like there's something wrong with you if you think that's normal."""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#5,"""おれは別に<br>誰かを守りたいって気持ちで<br>アークスになったわけじゃないけど……"""
Afin_20_020#0,"""やっぱ、ここを攻められたりすると<br>守りたいって自然と思うんだな。<br>なんか、自分自身がすっげえ不思議。"""
11_voice_NPC_5003_104#6,"""ダークファルスが復活したからか<br>アークス全体の空気が重いよなぁ。"""

text101#0,"""If you perform attacks, Photon Arts, Techniques and other special moves with good timing, they become more powerul. This is called a \""Just Attack\"". Not only do Just Attacks deal more damage, they also cause certain enemies to stagger more than usual.<br><br>To make an attack a Just Attack, you must use it after another attack. After you perform any attack, a red ring will appear around your body. If you time your next attack to the appearance of that red ring, it will become a Just Attack."""

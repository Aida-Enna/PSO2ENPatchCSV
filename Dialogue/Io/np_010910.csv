Alice_01_10#0,"""Hm? What is it, senpai? You look like you want something."""
Alice_01_20#0,"""If you have a question for me, I'll do my best to answer it."""
Alice_01_30#0,"""What did you say? Could I see myself in an interracial relationship?<br>...What exactly are you trying to ask me, senpai?"""
Alice_01_40#0,"""Hmm, I think you're up to something, senpai. You've got some ulterior motive. Fine, I'll give you an answer."""
Alice_01_50#0,"""Well... I wouldn't mind being with someone of another race."""
Alice_01_60#0,"""I mean, I'm a Dewman, after all. There aren't exactly many like me to choose from in the first place."""
Alice_01_70#0,"""Besides, if I fell in love with someone, I'd like to think their race or their appearance wouldn't matter..."""
Alice_01_80#0,"""...Ahh, what the heck am I saying?! Senpai, forget everything you just heard! This didn't happen! Oh, this is so embarrassing..."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#1,"""あ、センパイ……え、おれに質問？<br>すこしでもセンパイの役に立つなら<br>何でも聞いてくれよ。"""
Auyuku_01_020#0,"""えっ、色々な人と仲良くしてるけど<br>そのために心がけてることがあれば<br>教えてほしい……？"""
Auyuku_01_030#0,"""おれは、人付き合いは苦手だよ。<br>ただ、なぜか色々な人からお願いされて<br>クラスの宣伝とか、やってるけど……"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#0,"""……ううー！<br>センパイ、勘弁してくれ。<br>思い出すだけで恥ずかしくなる……！"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_105#0,"""え……？\u3000真面目に相手の話を<br>聞いてくれる所が頼られる理由……？<br>センパイが言うなら、そうなのかもな。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#1,"""このあたりには、あんまり<br>デューマンがいないか。<br>……みんな出撃中かな？"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_105#1,"""There's a lot of tall people around, so my neck gets tired from looking up all the time."""

11_voice_NPC_5091_104#2,"""I don't mind being a Dewman, but sometimes I catch people staring at me."""
Npc91_mb03_020#0,"""Maybe it would be better if I hid my horns with a hat for the time being."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#3,"""帽子？\u3000ああ、すぐやめたよ。<br>逆に目立ってしまってたまらない。"""
Npc91_mb04_020#0,"""注目されるのは別に良いけど<br>うっとりしたような表情で見られるのは<br>……流石にちょっと困るな。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#2,"""……この前、いきなり見ず知らずの人に<br>話しかけられて、ファッションの話を<br>延々とされちゃったよ。綺麗、ってさ。"""
Npc91_mb05_020#0,"""別に物珍しさで見られてるって<br>わけじゃなかったみたいだ。<br>……ちょっと自意識過剰だったかな。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#3,"""強い人の動きは参考になるよな。<br>どうやってるのか、少しずつ<br>わかってくるのも、楽しい。"""
Npc91_mb06_020#0,"""そういう人にも未熟だった時期があって<br>そこから上達したって考えると<br>なおさらやる気も出てくるしな。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#4,"""おれは強くなろうとは思ってないんだ。<br>ただ、弱いままでいたくないだけ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#4,"""イヤな雰囲気が漂ってるな。<br>おれでもわかるぐらいだよ、これは。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_106#0,"""あれが……ダークファルスか。<br>想像以上だったな。"""
Npc91_mb09_020#0,"""しかもあれで被害が少ない方って<br>話なんだろ？<br>たまらないな、まったく。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#5,"""暴走龍っていうのが話題になってるけど<br>おれはろくに会わないから<br>どうにもしっくりこないんだよな。"""
Npc91_mb10_020#0,"""暴走してるんなら、もっと行く先々で<br>襲ってきそうなもんだろ？"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#6,"""戦技大会？<br>あんまり興味はないかな。<br>おれはいち見学者でいいよ。"""
Npc91_mb11_020#0,"""目立つの、あんまり好きじゃないから。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#5,"""おれたちデューマンは防御面に<br>若干不安があるから、パーティーを<br>組んだほうが戦いやすいぜ。"""
Npc91_mb12_020#0,"""……ほとんどソロで動いてるおれが<br>言えた義理じゃないけどな。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#6,"""一人でいる理由？<br>だって、その方が気が楽じゃん。"""
Npc91_mb13_020#0,"""べつに他人が嫌いってわけじゃないぜ。<br>必要ならちゃんと協力するし<br>話すのが怖いってわけじゃない。"""
Npc91_mb13_030#0,"""ただ、自分から話しかけるのって<br>……なんだか照れくさいだろ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#7,"""センパイはさ、よくいろんな人と<br>話していたりするよな。<br>アークス内の知り合いも多い感じだし。"""
Npc91_mb14_020#0,"""一人だと気は楽だけど<br>ときどき、さびしかったりもするから<br>……ちょっと羨ましくもある。"""
Npc91_mb14_030#0,"""……なんだよ、その顔。<br>おれらしくないって？\u3000ああ、ああ<br>その通りだと、おれも思うよ！"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#8,"""もっと他のアークスと交流を、って？<br>いい、いいよ、そういうのは。<br>おれはそういうの、向いてない。"""
Npc91_mb15_020#0,"""おれは別に友達を作りたくて<br>アークスになったわけでもないんだ。<br>そういう交流は、最低限で十分。"""
Npc91_mb15_030#0,"""それに今は、センパイが<br>おれに話しかけてきてくれるだろ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_105#2,"""...I've got a bad feeling about this. I can't say what it is exactly, but I'm feeling really uncomfortable."""
Npc91_mb16_020#0,"""...You seem alright though, senpai. You're not gonna go suddenly disappearing on me, are you?"""
Npc91_mb16_030#0,"""Being able to talk to you has been really helpful. If I lost you... things would get a lot harder for me."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#7,"""……あ！<br>センパイ、無事だったんだな！<br>よかった……"""
Npc91_mb16zeno_020#0,"""ははっ……なんていうか、やっと<br>ほっとして、力が抜けたよ。<br>安心できた、って言うのかな。"""
Npc91_mb16zeno_030#0,"""センパイ……本当にお疲れさま。<br>こうしてまた会えて、話せて<br>……おれは嬉しい。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_106#1,"""The mood in ARKS has changed a surprising amount recently. You think so too, right, senpai?"""
Npc91_mb18_020#0,"""It feels like they've been more open when they communicate with us, right? I'm usually alone, so I pick up on these things."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#8,"""Is it because of what you did six months ago?<br>...I think I like it better this way."""
Npc91_mb19_010#0,"""最近、センパイ以外の人にも<br>話しかけられる事が増えたんだ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#9,"""あんまり、人と話すのは<br>得意じゃないけど……<br>別に、悪い気はしないから、いい。"""
Npc91_mb19_030#0,"""でもやっぱ、センパイと話してる時が<br>いちばん楽だな。気軽に話せる。<br>だからいつでも、話しかけてくれよ。"""
Npc91_mb20_010#0,"""Hey, senpai. If you've got a minute, want to hang out and talk?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#9,"""...N-no, I didn't have anything in mind. There's nothing to worry about, I just wanted to talk to you."""
Npc91_mb20_030#0,"""You don't have to treat me like a little kid. I'm fine, really."""
Npc91_mb21_010#0,"""よう、センパイ。<br>え？\u3000今日はパティさんたちと<br>一緒じゃないのかって？"""
Npc91_mb21_020#0,"""前回は、たまたまなんだよ。<br>話したと思うけど、頼み込まれて<br>ほんと仕方なく、なんだ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_106#2,"""ああ……思い出しただけで<br>恥ずかしくなってきた……<br>センパイ、頼むから忘れてくれ……"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#10,"""Whew... O-oh, senpai. Why was I sighing? Haha, it's nothing."""
Npc91_mb22_020#0,"""It's the first time I've had to myself for a while, so I was just relaxing. That's all."""
Npc91_mb22_030#0,"""There's really nothing to worry about, I'm fine. Thanks for your concern, though."""
Npc91_mb23_010#0,"""Say, where's Matoi? Are you on your own? That's rare these days."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#11,"""Ah, sorry, it's nothing. It's just, I see you two together so much, when you aren't it makes me wonder if something's happened."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#10,"""Haha, there I go, worrying about nothing. Everyone winds up alone from time to time, right? I shouldn't let it bother me."""
Npc91_mb23_after_010#0,"""...Why did things have to turn out this way?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#12,"""If only I'd been there, maybe I could have done something...."""
Npc91_mb23_after_030#0,"""All I can do now is wish I had as much power as you do, senpai."""
Npc91_mb24_010#0,"""There's a lot of things I want to say to Matoi when she comes back."""
Npc91_mb24_020#0,"""I was really sad when I heard she'd disappeared. It felt like... like I might never be happy again."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#11,"""So, senpai...<br>It might sound strange coming from me, but I'll ask you anyway. Please bring Matoi back home."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#12,"""Hey, senpai! Thank goodness... I was hoping I'd run into you."""
Npc91_mb24_after_020#0,"""This probably sounds strange coming from me, but... thank you. Thank you for bringing Matoi back."""
Npc91_mb24_after_030#0,"""I was really glad to see her again. Thank you so, so much."""
Npc91_mb25_010#0,"""You throw yourself into every issue around, don't you, senpai?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_102#0,"""Now you're getting involved with the Lillipans too."""
Npc91_mb25_030#0,"""I get that you're the type of person who likes to help out, but...<br>You should really pace yourself."""
Stratos_01_010#0,"""Huh?! Valentine's worries?!<br>...Well, I guess if you really want to hear it..."""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#13,"""There is something that's stumping me. I don't get how you're supposed to give people chocolate."""
Stratos_01_030#0,"""It's better to wear something cute when you're offering it, right? So maybe I should wear... No, no, I'm fine as I am!"""

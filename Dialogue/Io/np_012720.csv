Npc91_mb19_010#0,"""最近、センパイ以外の人にも<br>話しかけられる事が増えたんだ。"""

Npc91_mb19_030#0,"""でもやっぱ、センパイと話してる時が<br>いちばん楽だな。気軽に話せる。<br>だからいつでも、話しかけてくれよ。"""
Npc91_mb20_010#0,"""あ、センパイ。<br>ヒマなら少し、話していかないか？"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#8,"""……べ、別に何かあったわけじゃない。<br>ただセンパイと話したくなっただけで<br>心配されるようなことは、ないよ。"""
Npc91_mb20_030#0,"""そんな子供扱いしないでくれって。<br>おれは大丈夫だから、さ。"""
Npc91_mb21_010#0,"""よう、センパイ。<br>え？\u3000今日はパティさんたちと<br>一緒じゃないのかって？"""
Npc91_mb21_020#0,"""前回は、たまたまなんだよ。<br>話したと思うけど、頼み込まれて<br>ほんと仕方なく、なんだ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_106#2,"""ああ……思い出しただけで<br>恥ずかしくなってきた……<br>センパイ、頼むから忘れてくれ……"""

Npc91_mb22_020#0,"""久々に一人でのんびりしていた。<br>ほんと、それだけだよ。"""
Npc91_mb22_030#0,"""そんなに心配しなくても<br>おれなら大丈夫だからさ。<br>でも、気にかけてくれてありがとうな。"""

11_voice_NPC_5091_100#9,"""はは、勝手に心配しただけだよ。<br>いつも一緒にいる人がいないとさ。<br>余計なお世話だったかな、悪い。"""
Npc91_mb23_after_010#0,"""……どうして、こんな風なことに<br>なっちゃったんだろうな。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_104#11,"""おれさ、現場にいたわけじゃないけど<br>なんか出来たんじゃないかなって思うよ。"""
Npc91_mb23_after_030#0,"""センパイに頼ってもらえるくらいに<br>力があればいいのにって<br>今は、そう思えてしかたないんだ。"""
Npc91_mb24_010#0,"""マトイさんが帰ってきたら<br>言いたいことがたくさんあるんだ。"""
Npc91_mb24_020#0,"""いなくなって、さみしかったこと。<br>悲しかったこと、それから……<br>スゴく腹がたったこと。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#10,"""だからさ、センパイ……<br>おれが言うのも変だけど、頼むよ。<br>マトイさんを連れて帰ってきてくれ。"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_100#11,"""Hey, senpai! Thank goodness... I was hoping I'd run into you."""
Npc91_mb24_after_020#0,"""This probably sounds strange coming from me, but... thank you. Thank you for bringing Matoi back."""
Npc91_mb24_after_030#0,"""I was really glad to see her again. Thank you so, so much."""
Npc91_mb25_010#0,"""You throw yourself into every issue around, don't you, senpai?"""
11_voice_NPC_5091_102#0,"""Now you're getting involved with the Lillipans too."""
Npc91_mb25_030#0,"""I get that you're the type of person who likes to help out, but...<br>You should really pace yourself."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#1,"""I've been waiting for you...<br>Never thought I'd have a reason to say something like that. It feels like I'm facing a brand new enemy."""
st01_020#0,"""For you, it's only been a few moments. But we've been waiting for a long time..."""
st01_030#0,"""...Well, you're back now. And you even came to see me... I'm glad."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#2,"""I hear the Summoner class is all about fighting alongside your Pets, but I don't know what that actually looks like."""
st01_020#1,"""To be honest, I don't think I'll ever be good with anything but Braver. I'm still too immature to learn any new classes."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#3,"""I've been sent to investigate the Earth too."""
st01_020#2,"""I've been getting a strange feeling down there, and I think I've figured out why."""
st01_030#1,"""There aren't any Darkers in Tokyo. We've been fighting them for so long that not having them around feels weird."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#4,"""Is Matoi still off-duty? I guess I got used to seeing her with you, so not having her around is weird."""
st01_020#3,"""She woke up about six months ago, but she went back into Cold Sleep soon after, so I didn't get much of a chance to talk to her."""
st01_030#2,"""I know she's not gone for good, but it's a bit lonely without all the familiar faces around."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#1,"""I was surprised how cute Pets are. I guess it's nice to have creatures like that around."""
st01_020#4,"""They seem different from mags, somehow, but I can't place how."""
st01_010#0,"""So, Hitsugi's back. She has a much more cheerful look on her face than she did before."""
st01_020#5,"""I didn't want to pry, so I didn't ask her what was going on before...<br>Whatever it is, I'm glad it's resolved."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#5,"""Oh, senpai. Hitsugi's... I heard she's been kidnapped."""
st01_020#6,"""I was worried about pushing her away, so any time she came over I stuck to casual small talk..."""
st01_030#3,"""I should have been more assertive about asking if there was anything she was worried about.<br>...Please get her back soon."""
st01_010#1,"""I'm glad Hitsugi came back safely. She came to see me herself a little while ago."""
st01_020#7,"""We've had all sorts of problems here, but I'm glad you were at least able to save her. She looks more sure of herself, like she's overcome all her self-doubt."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_102#0,"""...Darkers really will show up anywhere, won't they?"""
st01_020#8,"""Well, I guess these ones are Phantoms, so it's hard to say whether they're really Darkers."""
st01_030#4,"""Either way, we can't let it slide. As ARKS, it's our main duty to protect everyone from Darkers."""
st01_010#2,"""I heard you've been having a lot of difficulties. And that there was a terrible sacrifice."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#2,"""But Aru's coming back, isn't he? Then I'll be here to welcome him with a smile."""
st01_010#3,"""The trouble on Earth is over, but given the history of the Photoners, there's probably something similar right around the corner."""
st01_020#9,"""And we stil have to do something about the [Profound Darkness]...<br>We've got a lot to think about."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#3,"""But you're back with us now, senpai.<br>...It probably sounds weird coming from me, but let's do our best out there."""
sq01_010#0,"""最初、行方不明って話を聞いたとき<br>嘘だって思ってたんだ。<br>センパイがいなくなるわけないって。"""
sq01_020#0,"""でも、しばらく本当に姿が見えなくて<br>どんどん不安になっていって……"""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#4,"""……だから、こうしてまた会えて<br>それが一番嬉しいんだ、おれは。<br>おかえり、センパイ。"""
sq02_010#0,"""It probably doesn't mean anything, but this is the first time I've had so few missions since I joined ARKS."""
sq02_020#0,"""It's not like I've had nothing to do, just that I've been feeling a bit underused lately..."""
sq02_030#0,"""I guess if there really is nothing going on, that means we're at peace."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_108#0,"""...I'm sorry, senpai. You were fighting right in front of me, but I couldn't do anything to help you..."""
sq13_020#0,"""No, it wasn't just me...<br>Everyone was overwhelmed. That Goddess of Demise had us all shaking in our shoes."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_105#1,""",,,I've been spending all this time training to fight any opponent...<br>...But there's no way I can begin to fight this one."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_102#1,"""...Oh, senpai. I'm sorry about before. I was feeling really pathetic."""
ep6_sq00_02#0,"""But Xiao contacted me and told me to do what I can. He shook me out of my funk, you know?"""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#6,"""So I think the best thing I can do right now is to work hard for...<br>For you, senpai."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_105#2,"""...Haha, hey senpai. I feel so pathetic, all I can do is laugh..."""
ep6_sq01_02#0,"""What are we supposed to do when there's no Xiao to give us orders any more..."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#7,"""You haven't given up yet, senpai...?<br>You think there's still a chance...?<br>Then I won't give up either...!"""
11_voice_NPC_5272_100#5,"""Senpai! You did it! This is really great news..."""
ep6_sq02_02#0,"""No matter what happens, we should never give up. Thank you for teaching me that, senpai!"""
11_voice_NPC_5272_108#1,"""When Xiao came back, I thought that we'd be back to normal in no time. I guess it wasn't to be."""
ep6_sq02_01_02#0,"""I can't help feeling down. The real battle is all still to come."""
ep6_sq03_02_01_01#0,"""Oh, hey senpai. I've been doing my best to support you."""
ep6_sq03_02_01_02#0,"""The things you're taking on are way above my pay grade, but I'm still an ARKS."""
Stratos_01_010#0,"""Huh?! Valentine's worries?!<br>...Well, I guess if you really want to hear it..."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_104#8,"""There is something that's stumping me. I don't get how you're supposed to give people chocolate."""
Stratos_01_030#0,"""It's better to wear something cute when you're offering it, right? So maybe I should wear... No, no, I'm fine as I am!"""
text01#0,"""Welcome back, senpai. And thank you very much."""
11_voice_NPC_5272_103#0,"""That last battle... it looked impossible to survive. I mean, she was Shiva, and you're just you. But you came back safe after all. I'm so relieved."""
text03#0,"""You've been working really hard all this time. There's still a few Darkers left, but please get some rest."""

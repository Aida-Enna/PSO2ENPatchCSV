text02#0,"""My name is Asuna. I'm Kirito's adventuring partner."""
11_voice_NPC_5665_100#0,"""I hope we can be friends."""
text01#1,"""This outfit brings back a lot of memories. I was wearing it when I first got to know Kirito."""
text02#1,"""Back then, I was known as the sub-leader of the Knights of the Blood...<br>I felt like if I wasn't strong enough...<br>Any day could have been my last."""
11_voice_NPC_5665_100#1,"""Kirito and I weren't nearly as close back then as we are now. Hehe, now that I think about it, I used to be very stubborn."""
text04#0,"""There are lots of memories, both good and bad, tied up with this outfit. I'm glad to have a chance to wear it again!"""
text01#2,"""From what I've heard, you can fish on each of the different planets, is that right? I wonder what you can catch."""
text02#2,"""That reminds me of the time Kirito caught the King of Lakes. How nostalgic~"""
text03#0,"""Is there anything as big as that that we could catch here?"""
11_voice_NPC_5665_101#0,"""There's such a rich variety of fashion and room items here! I love it!"""
text02#3,"""There's so many cute ones that I want to buy! What is it you use here, Meseta?"""
text03#1,"""Window shopping is fun no matter what world you're in."""
text01#3,"""私たちが元々いた世界……<br>《ＡＬＯ》には<br>仲間たちがいるの。"""
text02#4,"""昔からの知り合いもいて……<br>そうね、一言でいえば戦友かな。"""
text03#2,"""そろそろ帰らないと<br>皆寂しがっちゃうし、私も寂しい。<br>でもね……"""
text04#1,"""人との出会いは、いつも奇跡で<br>大切なもの。私にはそれを<br>教えてくれた人がいるから……"""
text05#0,"""だから、今は一緒に楽しみましょう。<br>いつかあなた達を《ＡＬＯ》に<br>ご招待したいな。皆喜ぶと思うよ！"""

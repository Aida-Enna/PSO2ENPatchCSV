pr_068040_0010#0,"""I'm sorry you had to take care of that sudden request on your day off!"""
pr_068040_0020#0,"""Don't worry. We were able to make friends with Kirito and Asuna, and it was a lot of fun!<br>Right, <%me>?"""
pr_068040_0030#0,"""Right right, about those two. First, my contact with Enga..."""
pr_068040_0040#0,"""He couldn't find any record of anyone accessing Oracle from Earth."""
pr_068040_0050#0,"""Furthermore, there doesn't appear to be any game on Earth that goes by the name ALO."""
pr_068040_0060#0,"""What, but how can that... Were they really from a completely different world?"""
pr_068040_0065#0,"""It felt like they were very careful to point out they were from another world..."""
pr_068040_0070#0,"""You're right. It was probably a half-truth."""
pr_068040_0075#0,"""What do you mean, Xiera?"""
pr_068040_0080#0,"""I've run the calculations on 72 hypotheses, and the most probably conclusion I came to is..."""
pr_068040_0090#0,"""They are from another world's Earth, different from Enga's Earth."""
pr_068040_0100#0,"""A different world with the same name...? How is that possible?"""
pr_068040_0110#0,"""Are you familiar with the concept of parallel universes? You may have also heard of multiverses and alternate dimensions. In short..."""
pr_068040_0120#0,"""The idea is that there exist other universes almost exactly like ours, but slightly different."""
pr_068040_0130#0,"""In actuality, we've had cases in the past where ARKS got lost in unknown dimensions after issues occurred during teleportation."""
pr_068040_0140#0,"""The exact causes are unknown, but something resulted in interference between \""The Seed\"" in their Earth and ESC-A in ours..."""
pr_068040_0150#0,"""Resulting in a miraculous link that allowed them to login to Oracle like with PSO2."""
pr_068040_0160#0,"""And their avatars are Phantoms embodied from their strong memories and feelings."""
pr_068040_0170#0,"""So my theory is that their actual bodies are just playing the game while they operate those avatars within Oracle."""
pr_068040_0175#0,"""They did mention that their outfits were from a world they'd been to in the past, rather than the one they had just been in."""
pr_068040_0176#0,"""They were pretty strange themselves."""
pr_068040_0177#0,"""I wonder if something happened in that world."""
pr_068040_0180#0,"""I don't know what happened to them...<br>But those clothes must have held some unforgettable memories."""
pr_068040_0190#0,"""But... miracles don't last forever. Now they've returned to their own world, they likely won't be able to return to Oracle again."""
pr_068040_0200#0,"""What... We won't ever see them again? After all that time we spent together... We said we'd meet again..."""
pr_068040_0210#0,"""Oh! This message... it's from Asuna?!"""
pr_068040_0220#0,"""Good, it went through. So hey, Kirito..."""
pr_068040_0230#0,"""<%me>! I just can't accept our loss after all."""
pr_068040_0240#0,"""One more match! Let me get my revenge before we go back!"""
pr_068040_0250#0,"""I'll be waiting at the same spot! I came up with a secret plan. This time I'll win!"""
pr_068040_0260#0,"""Kirito doesn't handle losing well. Matoi, I'd like to try more of this world's food. Let's go to Franka's Cafe!"""
pr_068040_0270#0,"""...How great! We do get to see them again...!"""
pr_068040_0280#0,"""You'll probably have to part with them eventually...<br>But until then, you should enjoy your time together with them to its fullest."""
pr_068040_0290#0,"""Yeah...! Let's go, <%me>!"""

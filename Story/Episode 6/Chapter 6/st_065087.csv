st_065080_0940#0,"""...Alright. We've finished setting the stage. The rest is up to you, Sukuna-hime."""
st_065080_0950#0,"""Leave it to me!"""
st_065080_0960#0,"""Wha...?!"""
st_065080_0962#0,"""Here!"""
st_065080_0963#0,"""Gh!"""
st_065080_0966#0,"""...Was that ash?!"""
st_065080_0970#0,"""Hah hah, your expression has finally changed, o' great Goddess of Demise."""
st_065080_0980#0,"""...Sukuna-hime!"""
st_065080_0990#0,"""You... Priestess of Harkotan. How could one who is bound to their planet be here!"""
st_065080_1000#0,"""Truly, now... I am well aware of your craftiness, but never did I expect you would mimic my ash."""
st_065080_1010#0,"""The Ashen ring that Alma and Xiao created has encircled this region of the cosmos. Teleportation is now a trifle."""
st_065080_1020#0,"""So focused was your attention on the assault from the ARKS that you paid not a single mind to it."""

st_065080_1060#0,"""That too is obvious! For what other reason could I have chosen to appear here in person!"""
st_065080_1070#0,"""This is... Ashen wind, and Dragoncrystals...!"""

st_065080_1090#0,"""The entire power of the ARKS... I leave it all to you!"""
st_065080_1100#0,"""This...! This power is...! What an odious sight...!"""
st_065080_1110#0,"""Why can you not see that this is the same mistake the Photoners once made!"""
st_065080_1120#0,"""It's not a mistake."""
st_065080_1130#0,"""It's not a mistake."""
st_065080_1140#0,"""This is to stop you."""
